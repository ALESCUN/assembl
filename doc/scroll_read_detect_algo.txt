Data we have:

Scroll position.
Message size.
Time spent.
Height of page

Parameters:
Message top
Message botom:
Message % of height of page


Variables: 
Message covers screen totally (implies internal scroll)

Fudge factor:
Max speedreading speed
Max pick speed

Reader words per minute:  average 275 WPM for prose text.  1000 WPM is top 1%
Character per word: 5 => multipy WPM*5 to get CPM

Character per line:  normally between 45 to 75, 66 is considered ideal.

Average character per line = div width / font size in px*0.4
Average line height = 1.5 * font size in pixels (gotcha:  ideally substract non-character size of message, but still count header)

The goal of all this is to calculate the scrool speed in WPM

Is scrool scrool wheel vs scrollbar clicking 


State Transition	Attention score		User action
READ			CERTAIN ATTENTION	Link was followed from message, preview was opened, message was marked read manually, message was hoisted
READ			PROBABLE ATTENTION	Email loaded image, slow scroll within long message
UNREAD			POSSIBLE ATTENTION	Scrolled over preview with reasonnable speed, Was marked unread manually
READ			UNLIKELY ATTENTION	Was marked read in bulk with no previous UNREAD, POSSIBLE ATTENTION
UNREAD			PROBABLE ATTENTION	  

Each should have a counter, or log multiple to have date statistics?


Heuristics:
Messagge bigger than screen and scrolled within => read

Stopping statisticaly each pagefull of messages => all messages on previous page read  Remember to deal with inertia, jerk


Logging scrool:  detect start time, end time, distance scrolled for each event.  Then distribute data on messages.


LOG (for scrool event):  Date first event, date last event, highest scrool score, number of scrool events.
